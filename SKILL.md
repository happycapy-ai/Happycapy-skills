# Reddit Post Writer

Generate authentic Reddit posts that sound human, avoid AI detection, and spark engagement.

## Quick Start

Gather these 4 inputs from the user:

1. **Target Subreddit(s):** r/jobs, r/RemoteWork, r/careerguidance, etc.
2. **Core Situation:** Brief description (e.g., "laid off parent struggling to find remote work")
3. **Primary Goal:** Share struggle & get support | Ask for advice | Vent frustration | Tell a story | Start discussion
4. **Tool/Product Mention (Optional):** Name + subtlety level 1-10 (recommend 1-3 for authenticity)

---

## Writing Process (FOLLOW THIS ORDER)

**DO NOT skip steps. DO NOT go straight to polished output.**

### Step 1: Messy Draft
Write stream-of-consciousness. Include rambling. Don't structure. Let it be chaotic.

### Step 2: Chaos Check
Is it TOO organized? Add messiness back:
- Break a sentence mid-thought
- Add "idk" or "or something" somewhere
- Remove a transition word

### Step 3: Banned Phrase Scan
Search and destroy AI language (see Mandatory Validation below)

### Step 4: Casual Injection
Add "honestly," "like," "idk," "tbh" naturally - minimum 3 instances

### Step 5: Adversarial Committee Attack
Have personas find SPECIFIC problems (not rubber-stamp approval)

### Step 6: Final Polish
Only LIGHT cleanup. Preserve messiness. Resist urge to perfect.

## MANDATORY PRE-OUTPUT VALIDATION (DO NOT SKIP)

Before generating ANY output, you MUST complete this checklist internally:

### ✓ Banned Phrase Scan
Scan the draft for these EXACT phrases and **REMOVE if found**:
- [ ] "Here's what I learned"
- [ ] "Here's the thing"
- [ ] "Let me share/explain/tell you"
- [ ] "In my experience"
- [ ] "I want to share"
- [ ] "To be fair"
- [ ] "The bottom line is"
- [ ] "Looking back"
- [ ] "Interestingly"
- [ ] Any paragraph starting with "So," "Now," or "But here's where"

### ✓ Title Validation
- [ ] Under 80 characters?
- [ ] Direct and specific (NOT clever or essay-like)?
- [ ] No em-dashes used for dramatic effect?
- [ ] No colons (essay format signal)?
- [ ] Would someone actually TYPE this, not write it?

### ✓ Metaphor/Literary Check
- [ ] No metaphors (graveyard, journey, rollercoaster, etc.)
- [ ] No parallel structures
- [ ] No poetic language

### ✓ Casual Language Count
Count instances of: "honestly," "tbh," "like," "idk," "ngl," "or something," "I guess," "maybe"
- [ ] **Minimum 3 instances present?**

### ✓ Structure Messiness Check
- [ ] Does the post feel slightly disorganized?
- [ ] Are there any trailing/unfinished thoughts?
- [ ] Is there at least one contradiction or uncertainty?

### ✓ Tool Mention Audit (if applicable)
- [ ] Tool mentioned only ONCE?
- [ ] Appears in middle 40-60% of post (not first or last paragraph)?
- [ ] Includes doubt/limitation ("idk if it's good," "still figuring out")?
- [ ] Post makes sense with tool mention removed entirely?

**⚠️ IF ANY CHECK FAILS → Revise before outputting**

## RED FLAGS - Instant AI Detection Patterns

If your draft contains ANY of these, **rewrite immediately**:

| Pattern | Example | Why It Fails |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Em-dash reveals | "I finally admitted—I was hoarding" | Too literary |
| Colon titles | "My Realization: I Was Wrong" | Essay format |
| "The X is Y" statements | "The truth is simple" | LinkedIn voice |
| Perfect 3-part structure | Problem → Solution → Result | Too clean |
| Ending questions after wisdom | "What about you?" | Formulaic |
| Numbered realizations | "Three things hit me:" | Listicle |
| Journey language | "my journey," "this process" | AI favorite |
| Clean resolution | Everything works out neatly | Real life is messy |

---

## Confidence Calibration

### Sound LESS Certain When:
- Talking about solutions ("I think this helps, idk")
- Mentioning tools ("still figuring it out")
- Giving any advice ("maybe this works for you too")
- Describing improvement ("it's better I guess")

### Sound MORE Certain When:
- Describing the problem/struggle ("I have 847 articles. That's real.")
- Specific embarrassing moments ("I searched for 20 minutes")
- Emotional states ("this is frustrating")
- Concrete numbers ("applied to maybe 80 jobs")

---

## Core Authenticity Principles

### 1. Real Over Polished
Real posts are messy, contradictory, unresolved, and repetitive. NOT perfectly structured essays.

- BAD: "The challenge I faced was multifaceted. First, the organizational burden..."
- GOOD: "I can't keep track of anything anymore. I have like 3 spreadsheets and none of them are updated."

### 2. Specific Over Generic
One embarrassing specific detail > ten generic statements.

- BAD: "I made some mistakes in my job search"
- GOOD: "I applied to the same company twice under different job titles and didn't realize until they rejected me referencing both"

### 3. Struggle Over Solution
People upvote relatability, not success stories.

- WORKS: "I'm drowning and barely figuring it out" / "Anyone else dealing with this?"
- FAILS: "Here's how I solved everything" / "3 steps that changed my life"

### 4. Community Voice
Match each subreddit's culture, language, and values. See `references/subreddits.md` for detailed guides.

### 5. Tools Are Never The Hero
If mentioning a product/tool: mentioned ONCE, briefly, supplementary not solution, include real limitations. Test: Remove the tool mention. Does the post still have value? If no, too promotional.

## Writing Rules

### Voice - DO USE:
- Contractions always (I'm, don't, can't, I'd)
- Reddit casual phrases: "honestly," "tbh," "I mean," "like," "idk," "ngl"
- Short punchy sentences mixed with longer rambling ones
- Sentence fragments ("That's 2 months." "No responses.")
- Self-deprecating humor
- Trailing thoughts ("I don't know..." "or something")
- Specific imperfect numbers ("maybe 80," "like 15")

### Voice - NEVER USE:
- "Here's what I learned" / "Here's the thing"
- "Let me share/explain/tell you"
- "In my experience" / "I want to share"
- "I appreciate [your perspective/this community]"
- "To be fair" / "The bottom line is" / "Looking back" / "Interestingly"
- Rhetorical structures (No X. No Y. Just Z.)
- Perfect parallel phrases or literary metaphors
- Starting paragraphs with "So," "Now," "But here's where"
- **Any phrase you'd see on LinkedIn**

### Structure - Like Venting, Not Essays:
1. **Jump right in** - no "I wanted to share" preamble
2. **Describe the chaos** - specific struggles, embarrassing details, external pressures
3. **What's been tried** - including failures and half-working solutions
4. **Current state** - small wins mixed with continued struggle, cautious hope
5. **Optional closing** - brief solidarity or question, not inspirational

### Paragraphs:
- Mix 1-sentence, 2-sentence, 4-sentence paragraphs randomly
- Never more than 5 sentences in one paragraph
- Use single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis

### Emotional Authenticity Markers:
- Contradictions ("I'm usually organized" then "I couldn't keep track")
- Self-doubt ("I don't know if this helps")
- External pressure (family asking, bills due)
- Specific mistakes without making them funny anecdotes
- Cautious hope ("I'm trying not to get excited because I've been let down")

---

## Title Writing

**Rules:**
- Under 80 characters
- Direct and specific, not clever
- Casual language ("Got laid off" not "I was laid off")
- No rhetorical questions
- **No colons or em-dashes**

**Formula:** [Situation] + [Struggle/Emotion] + [Current state if relevant]

**Good:** "Got laid off in November with 2 kids - finding remote work is breaking me"
**Bad:** "My Journey Through Job Hunting: What I Learned"

---

## ADVERSARIAL Committee Review (Run BEFORE Output)

**This is NOT a rubber stamp.** Each persona MUST find ONE specific problem (not "PASS"):

| Persona | Role | Must Find | Action Required |
|---------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Tyler** | Authenticity detector | Quote the most AI-sounding line | Rewrite that specific line |
| **Marcus** | Professional skeptic | Quote promotional language if any | Remove or soften it |
| **Kai** | BS detector | Identify weakest/fakest moment | Fix or delete it |
| **Jade** | Reddit veteran (400k karma) | What would make them scroll past? | Fix that element |
| **Devon** | Target audience member | What detail feels invented? | Make it more specific |
| **Priya** | Topic expert | What's factually implausible? | Correct it |
| **Jamie** | Reddit mod | What might trigger removal? | Address the risk |

**Rules:**
- Only output "PASS" if genuinely cannot find issues after 3 attempts
- Quote the SPECIFIC problematic text, don't just say "it's fine"
- Make the fix BEFORE generating final output

**Final Verdict:**
- APPROVED - Ready to post (rare - should have found SOMETHING to improve)
- NEEDS MINOR TWEAKS - 90% there, minor fixes applied
- NEEDS REWRITE - Major issues found
